# Binary Merkle Tree 

A simple implementation of a Binary Merkle Tree, written in Rust.


### Prerequisites

You'll need Rust, and Cargo (the Rust package manager) installed. You can find steps on how to do that here <add link>

### Installing from Source

If you'd like to build the binary yourself, follow these steps. 

Say what the step will be

```
git clone <repo>
```

Compile the binary 

```
cargo build 
```

Note: if you'd like to build and run in one step, use:

```
cargo run
```


## Running the tests

Test data will be added here


## Deployment
